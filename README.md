# personalcv

# Description
   This is a simple flutter application for developers who want to present themselves in a new way. It gets powered by a basic yii2 backend and admin panel to which you can add your skills, projects, personal data and etc... on it.
Backend code also is open source and you can find it at https://github.com/faridfajrak/personal_cv_backend.
You can simply deploy yii application on any host and add your user auth_key to API_KEY and your api url to BASE_UR in /lib/repository/rest_handler.dart.
